## Relays (2 types)
- Electromechanical relays
- Solid state relays

Working princiciple of relays and contactors are the same.

Time delay relay?

Vacuum relays?

Current sensing relays? 
- see KCS current sensing relays from TE.
- comes with current sensor?

Relays with Auxiliary contact:
- aux contact provides feedback that the relay has open/closed. 
- example LEV100H from TE.
