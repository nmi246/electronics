#### op-amp slew rate:
- Slew rate is defined as the maximum rate of change of an op amps output voltage, and is given in units of volts per microsecond. Slew rate is measured by applying a large signal step, such as one volt, to the input of the op amp, and measuring the rate of change from 10% to 90% of the output signal's amplitude.
