| QFP | Quad flat package.   | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42329930/200685597-4dd68150-46d3-474c-8ffa-f1ce2299a802.png) |
| QFN | Quad Flat No-lead.<br /> A very small square-shaped or rectangular surface-mount plastic package with no leads. It's basically a QFP package, except for the absence of leads protruding from its sides. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42329930/200685707-7aa5f864-b6cd-4dec-8b56-23759b4f1e82.png) |
| DFN | Dual flat no-lead.<br /> Similar to the QFN, except that QFN has pads all around the periphery of the package instead of just two sides like the DFN. Since DFN has no leads and has shorter bond wire lengths, it provides a higher electrical performance than leaded packages due to less inductance. |  |
| TDFN | Dual flat no-lead   | Thin DFN, smaller than DFN  |
| DIP | Dual in-line package | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42329930/200685802-bddbc6a6-54f2-41cf-8a81-c4af4587b694.png) |
| SMX (SMA,B,C) | Surface Mount X | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42329930/200690920-f884c16b-f16c-4fa9-8e5b-84cfcdd3aadb.png) |
| SOIC | Small outline integrated circuit | pitch = 1.27mm, lower thermal resistance, larger overall, than MSOP.  |
| MSOP | Micro small outline package | smaller than SOIC but looks the same. SOIC performance may be a little better. Pitch=0.65mm |
| TSSOP | Thin shrink small outline package |  |
| WSOP  | Wide small outline package  |   |


SIP Single In-line Package
SSIP - Shrink Single In-line Package
HSIP- Single In-line Package with Heatsink
The package density can be raised although it becomes high profile as the lead is vertically arranged in a long boundary line of the package. It is not only for IC but also used for the network resistor.
