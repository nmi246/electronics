- The IGBT is a power switching transistor which combines the advantages of MOSFETs and BJTs for use in power supply and motor control circuits.
- is something of a cross between a conventional BJT and a MOSFET, making it ideal as a semiconductor switching device.
- The IGBT combines the insulated gate (hence the first part of its name) technology of the MOSFET with the output performance characteristics of a conventional bipolar transistor, (hence the second part of its name).
- The IGBT has a much lower “on-state” resistance, Ron than an equivalent MOSFET.
