UVLO: TLV840
UVLO use: During operation, if the power supply voltage drops and becomes lower than the UVLO detection voltage, UVLO brings the internal circuit into a semi-standby state to prevent malfunction. When the power supply voltage rises and becomes higher than the UVLO release voltage, UVLO is released and the operation restarts.
When operating a power device such as IGBT, if the gate voltage of the controlled power device drops, conduction loss increases, causing a loss increase and device destruction. A gate driver IC coupler for pre-driving such a power device may incorporate the UVLO function to control the above phenomenon
