## What is a soft starter:

- type of motor starter that uses the voltage reduction technique to reduce the voltage during the starting of the motor.
- offers gradual increase in voltage during motor startup allowing the motor to slowly accelerate & gain speed.
- Prevents mechanical tear & jerking due to sudden supplying of full voltage.

- The torque of an induction motor is directly proportional to the square of the current, which depends on the supply voltage. So the supply voltage can be used to control the starting torque. In a normal motor starter, applying full voltage to the motor generates maximum starting torque which possess mechanical hazard to the motor.
- Thus, a soft starter reduces starting torque & gradually increases it in a safe manner until it reaches its rated speed. At rated speed, the soft starter resumes the full voltage supply through it.

- During motor stopping, the supply voltage is gradually reduced to smoothly decelerate the motor. At zero speed, it breaks the input voltage supply to the motor.

- The main component used for the regulation of voltage in a soft starter is a Thyristor (SCR). Adjusting the firing angle of the thyristor regulates the voltage supplying through it. Other components such as OLR (overload relay) are used for overcurrent protection.

## Working Principle:
The main component used for controlling the voltage in a soft starter is a thyristor. It is a controlled rectifier that starts conduction of the current flow in only one direction when a gate pulse is applied called the firing pulse.

The angle of the firing pulse determine how much of the input voltage cycle should be allowed through it. Since AC swings between maximum & minimum peak forming a complete 360° cycle, we can use the angle of firing pulse to switch on the thyristor for a specific duration and control the supplied voltage.

The firing pulses can vary between 0° to 180°. The decrease in the angle of firing pulse increases the conduction period of thyristor, thus allowing high voltage through it.

Two such thyristors are connected in back-to-back formation for each phase. So it can control the current in both directions. Each half cycle, the firing angle

The three pairs of thyristors, each pair for individual phase are used for controlling the voltage to start & stop the motor. The thyristor conduction period depends on the firing angle controlled by the logic circuitry.

The logic circuitry contains PID controller or a simple microcontroller programmed to generate pulses. The controller is isolated from the supply mains using opto-isolator & a rectifier is used for supplying DC source. The pulses generated by microcontroller are fed to a thyristor firing circuit that amplifies it before triggering the SCR.

When the motor starts up, the controller generates pulses for each individual SCR. The pulse is generated based on the zero crossing that is detected using a zero crossing detector. The first firing pulse angle is approximately near 180° (very low conduction period) to allow minimum voltage.

Gradually after each zero crossing, the angle of firings pulses starts decreasing, increasing the conduction period of thyristor. The voltage through thyristor starts increasing. Hence the motor speed gradually increases.

Once the motor attains its full rated speed (at 0° firing angle), the thyristors are completely bypassed using a bypass contactor under normal operation. It increases the efficiency of the soft starter since the SCR stops firing. During motor stopping, the SCR takes the control & starts firing in orderly fashion to reduce the supply voltage.

The bypass contactors can be internal or external. The internal bypass contactors are embedded inside the power switches. Each SCR have a bypass switch in parallel that supply the current under normal condition. Such contactors configuration takes small space & the starters are in compact design. While the external bypass contactors are connected externally in parallel with the soft starter. Such soft starter are bulky.

The bypass contactors are not meant to break or make the current supply to the circuit, thus it can be a low rated contactors.




Advantages of Soft Starter
Smooth Startup: Unlike conventional motor starter, it provides very gradual increase of voltage thus speed that results in a very smooth startup. There is no mechanical stress whatsoever or jerks that can damage the motor.

Acceleration & Deceleration Control: It offers a fully adjustable acceleration & deceleration of the motor. Varying the firing angle slowly or quickly can control the acceleration during startup & deceleration during stopping of motor. This is used in application where startup acceleration needs to be adjusted.

No Power Surges: Since the conventional motor starter allows full voltage across the motor, a huge inrush current start flowing into the motor that cause a power surge in the circuit. the soft starter limits such current thus preventing the power surges.

Multiple Startups: Some applications require the motor to start & stop multiple times in small period of time. such motor if used with a conventional starter will experience overheating due to high starting current. However, soft starters drastically increases the number of startups for a motor in a specific duration.  

Reduction of Overheating: The motor overheating is a very serious problem. It occurs due to the high winding current during its startup. The soft starter allows a very small amount of starting current which prevents the overheating of motor.

Increased Life Span: The soft starter as compared to a conventional starter improves the life time of the motor. it is due to the smooth operation & absence of electrical & mechanical stress on the motor.

Less Maintenance: Due to its smooth operation, the induction motor is less likely to have any mechanical faults, which is why it require less maintenance as opposed to conventional motor starter.

Efficiency: A conventional motor starter supply full voltage (very high inrush current) to the motor that consumes too much energy. A soft starter significantly reduces it & allows a gradual increase in energy consumption. Also the power switches are controlled using very low voltage level. It improves the overall efficiency of the motor.   

Compact & Small Size: The soft starter has a very compact design that takes up very small space. Unlike other motor starters, it has very small size.

Low Cost: compared to other starters such as VFD, this sure does cost cheaper.

Disadvantages of Soft Motor Starter
No Speed regulation: The soft starter only allows the control of input voltage supply i.e. from 0 volts to line voltage with a fixed line frequency. Since the frequency is constant the motor speed is constant & only regulates by the load connected with it. The speed of induction motor is regulated by varying the supply frequency below or above the line frequency according to the need. Such feature is only available in VFD (variable frequency drive).

Heat dissipation: The semiconductor switches inside the soft starter dissipates some energy in the form of heat. Therefore, it also requires heat sinks for cooling the power switches.

Reduced starting Torque: Since it reduces the input voltage that corresponds to the input current which is directly proportional to the starting torque of the induction motor, it significantly reduces the starting torque. This is why Soft starters are used for low or medium starting torque application.

Applications of Soft Starter
The soft starter is used in industries & is more appropriate to be used for motors that run on a constant speed.

Fans: The huge fans used in industries runs at a constant speed. However, they do require the startup protection. A soft starter is a best option for such fans.

Conveyer belts: The conveyer belts in industries are used for moving objects & it needs extra care. The sudden jerks during starting or stopping using conventional starter may misalign the belts, damages the belt due to mechanical stress & damage the objects placed on it. It requires a smooth starting & stopping offered by a soft starter

Motors using belt & pulleys: The motor that drives load through belts & pulleys cannot tolerate the sudden jerks. It wears the belt that couples it to the load. A soft starter offers a smooth starting for such motor applications.

Water or liquid Pump: Any type of pump connected with a motor requires a smooth starting & stopping due to the sudden pressure building inside the pipes. A conventional starter may generate enough pressure at startup to break the line. A soft starter offer gradual increase in the pressure to such liquid pumps. However, there is no speed control of the pump during normal operation. A VFD is a better choice for variable pump speed.
