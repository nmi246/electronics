## Acronyms 
| Acronym | Long form |  Definition |
|--|--|--|
| COB | Chip on board | The mounting of a bare LED chip in direct contact with a substrate (such as silicon carbide or sapphire) to produce LED arrays |
| MR | Melanopic ratio |  |
| CRI | Colour rendering index |  |
| PSF/KSF |--| A narrow band red producing phosphor, (often abbreviated PSF or KSF), used in LED lighting and displays |
| CCT | Correlated colour temperature | The colour appearance of a white LED. CCT is defined in degrees Kelvin; a warm light is ~2700K, neutral white at ~4000K, and cool white at ~5000K or more. |
