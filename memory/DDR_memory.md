DDR3 vs DDR3L (SDRAM):
- DDR3L operates at a lower voltage, hence are more energy-efficient compared to DDR3. 
- DDR3 operates at a standard voltage of 1.5V, whereas DDR3L operates at a voltage of 1.35V or lower.

DDR4L: 
- The key to DDR4L memory is that it requires less power to operate, with 1.2-volt
