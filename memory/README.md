## All things to do with both volatile memory (RAM, FRAM, etc) and non-volatile memory (SSD, EEPROM, FLASH, etc). 

## Various types of memory

### Static random-access memory: 
- (static RAM or SRAM) is a type of RAM that uses latching circuitry (flip-flop) to store each bit. SRAM is **volatile** memory; data is lost when power is removed.
- The term static differentiates SRAM from DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), which must be **periodically refreshed**. 
- SRAM is faster and more expensive than DRAM; it is typically used for the cache and internal registers of a CPU while DRAM is used for a computer's main memory.
