## All things to do with both volatile memory (RAM, FRAM, etc) and non-volatile memory (SSD, EEPROM, FLASH, etc). 

## Various types of memory

### Static random-access memory: 
- (static RAM or SRAM) is a type of RAM that uses latching circuitry (flip-flop) to store each bit. SRAM is **volatile** memory; data is lost when power is removed.
- The term static differentiates SRAM from DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), which must be **periodically refreshed**. 
- SRAM is faster and more expensive than DRAM; it is typically used for the cache and internal registers of a CPU while DRAM is used for a computer's main memory.

## DDR3, and DDR3L Memory
- The main difference between DDR3 and DDR3L is in the voltage specification (1.5V for DDR3, 1.35V for DDR3L). The letter L in DDR3L refers to low voltage standard. As DDR3L is a special type of DDR3 all other specifications except the voltage remains the same.
