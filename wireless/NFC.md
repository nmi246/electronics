### STSW-ST25RFAL002
- Software:
  - STSW-ST25RFAL002 is the implementation of the RF/NFC abstraction layer (RFAL) for the ST25R3916/16B, ST25R3917/17B, ST25R3918, and ST25R3920/20B devices.
  - The RFAL simplifies the development of applications by encapsulating device and protocol details. It provides a common interface that makes the upper software layers independent from the used device
  - The RFAL with the same APIs is available for all ST25R devices, thus simplifying the software efforts when migrating from one device to another.
- RF/NFC abstraction layer for ST25R3916 and its derivatives
