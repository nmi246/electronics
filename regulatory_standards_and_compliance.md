### RoHS (The Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS 1), 
Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, adopted in February 2003 by the European Union.
The initiative was to limit the amount of hazardous chemicals in electronics.
The RoHS 1 directive took effect on 1 July 2006, and is required to be enforced and became a law in each member state. This directive restricts (with exceptions) the use of ten hazardous materials in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment.
RoHS is often referred to as the "lead-free directive", but it restricts the use of the following ten substances:
1. Lead (Pb)
2. Mercury (Hg)
3. Cadmium (Cd)
4. Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+)
5. Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB)
6. Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE)
7. Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)
8. Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP)
9. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)
10. Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)

### LSZH (Low Smoke, Zero Halogen):
- more info: https://www.garlandcables.com.au/blog/what-is-lszh/
- LSZH stands for Low Smoke Zero Halogen. It refers to a group of jacket and insulation compounds that do not contain halogens within their chemical makeup.  The terms LSOH, HFFR (Halogen Free Fire Retardant) and NHFR (Non Halogenated Fire Retardant) are often used interchangeably.
- Many industries have seen an increasing demand for Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH) cables. Main driver of this increase is the concerns for the safety of people and electronic circuits during fire. Environmental protection and an increase in requirements / specifications from local and international communities has also heightened the demand for LSZH cables.
- This increased awareness of negative side effects arising from halogen when exposed to flames has lead to this jacket type being designed.
- Halogens are a group of elements that are characterized by being 1 electron short of forming a stable molecule, as a result they are highly reactive and will combine with other elements in order to gain this missing electron. Halogens react with metals to form salts, common table salt is a mixture of the halogen chlorine and the metal sodium. When mixed with water, free hydrogen in water will combine with halogens to make acids. One of the most common acids being Hydrochloric acid which is a mixture of hydrogen and chlorine.
- When PVC burns, it releases Chlorine which is now free to combine with hydrogen to form an acid. This acid can burn lungs and eyes of people trying to flee the fire. It can also attack equipment that was not destroyed in the fire.
- Benefits of LSZH cables: LSZH compounds contain no halogens and instead rely on releasing water or other non-toxic compounds in order to put out a flame. As a result, they are safer for both people and the environment.


### REACH:
REACH: Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals


### SVHC: Substances of very high concern
- Substances that may have serious effects on human health and the environment can be identified as substances of very high concern (SVHCs). These are primarily substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction as well as substances with persistent and bio-accumulative characteristics. Other substances of equivalent concern include, for example, endocrine disrupting chemicals.
- After a substance has been officially identified in the EU as being of very high concern, it will be added to the Candidate List. This list indicates to consumers and industry which chemicals are identified as SVHCs.
- Companies manufacturing or importing articles containing these substances in a concentration above 0,1% weight of the article, have legal obligations. They are required to inform recipients of the articles about the presence of the substance and therefore how to use it safely. They also need to inform consumers requesting this information.
- Substances placed on the Candidate List can move to the Authorisation List. This means that, after a given date, companies will not be allowed to place the hazardous substance on the market or to use it, unless they have been authorised to do so. One of the main aims of authorisation is to phase out SVHCs where possible.
- SVHCs include the following groups of chemicals:
  - Carcinogens, mutagens and/or reproductive toxicants (CMRs)
  - Persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic chemicals
  - Chemicals of equivalent concern
