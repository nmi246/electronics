### RoHS (The Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS 1), 
Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, adopted in February 2003 by the European Union.
The initiative was to limit the amount of hazardous chemicals in electronics.
The RoHS 1 directive took effect on 1 July 2006, and is required to be enforced and became a law in each member state. This directive restricts (with exceptions) the use of ten hazardous materials in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment.

1. Lead (Pb)
2. Mercury (Hg)
3. Cadmium (Cd)
4. Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+)
5. Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB)
